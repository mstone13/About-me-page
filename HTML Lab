        <h2> Education:<img src="Bill2.webp" alt="Bill" width="200" height="150"></h2>
            <p>This human that I am forcing to write my biography thinks that I have no formal education,
                but that is NOT TRUE! Through multiple possessed humans I have attended many respectable universities like Harvard, Backupsmore, West Coast Tech,
                and Juliard. So next time you think you don't have enough education,
                just look at what I've done and cry!
            </p>
        <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <p>It's not that I enjoy creating cults, it's that my followers simply love
                to come join me in my adventures! Ever wanted to be possessed by a multi-dimensional demon?
                Well, look no further! I enjoy making deals, using humans as puppets, and 
                occassionally tearing a hole in the space-time continum so that my 
                dimension spills into this one! Nothing huge.
            </p>
        <h2>Achievements: </h2>
            <p>Ever heard of Weirdmageddon? Of course you have! It was the best
                apocalypse/rave-to-end-the-world that anybody's ever seen! That was
                all me, kids! Of course, it would have been better if that Pines family
                hadn't ruined all of my plans. But another incredible achievement
                of mine was surviving their weak assassination attempt! I'll be back,
                so get ready!</p>
